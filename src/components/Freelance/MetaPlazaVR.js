        Since stepping into my role as Lead Developer and Co-Owner at Metaplaza
        VR in June 2023, I've been riding the crest of a wave where innovation
        meets community engagement. Our aim was audacious yet grounded: to
        empower the VRChat community with a revenue-generating tool,
        transforming virtual worlds into economic landscapes. And how did we
        plan to do this? By creating a Unity prefab that seamlessly integrates
        community-based advertisements into these immersive spaces. My
        responsibilities were as multi-dimensional as the worlds we were
        enhancing. I set up a robust server architecture using NGINX, ensuring a
        reliable backbone for our digital endeavors. On the software side, I
        crafted a dynamic backend using Node.js, which served as the engine room
        for our service. But what's an engine without a dashboard? I designed a
        compelling frontend using nextJS, React, and JavaScript, delivering an
        intuitive user experience that belies the complexity of the backend. As
        for the Unity prefab—where our idea comes to life in the VR world—I
        masterminded its development using C#, encapsulating our vision into a
        tangible asset. But we didn't stop at implementation; our plan also
        includes a data-driven approach to measure impact. We aim to collect
        rich metrics to understand from which platform and world location views
        are originating, thereby fine-tuning our offerings based on actual user
        engagement. At Metaplaza VR, I am not just a developer or a business
        owner; I am a catalyst for community empowerment and a pioneer at the
        intersection of virtual reality and real-world opportunity.
