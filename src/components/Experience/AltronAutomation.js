        At Altron Automation, I wore multiple hats, each stitched with the
        threads of ingenuity and customer focus, as I stepped into the role of a
        Controls Engineer. I wasn't just designing electrical schematics for
        custom machinery; I was crafting the intricate blueprints that breathed
        life into complex, automated ecosystems. My contributions extended into
        the digital sphere, where I helped curate an expansive AutoCAD
        Electrical library, setting the gold standard for engineering
        documentation within the company. Coding was another realm where I
        thrived. As a maestro of PLC, HMI, and Robot code, I orchestrated a
        seamless integration of disparate components, making the machine
        processes sing in harmonious unison. But my role transcended the digital
        and the theoretical. I was also the face of Altron in customer
        environments, providing on-site support that was as technically rigorous
        as it was consultative. Here, I acted as the vital conduit, connecting
        the machinery we developed to our clients' existing systems and
        Manufacturing Execution System (MES) infrastructures. Every wire I laid,
        every line of code I wrote, and every customer interaction I
        facilitated, were all notes in a larger compositionâ€”aimed at achieving
        operational excellence and customer satisfaction.
