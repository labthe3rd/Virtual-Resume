      <p className="mt-4">
        During my tenure at MarquipWardUnited from May 2015 to December 2016, I
        emerged as a linchpin in engineering innovation, relentlessly pursuing
        optimization at every corner. I successfully reconfigured the Variable
        Frequency Drives (VFDs), turbocharging the Double Backer's operational
        speed. Driven by a desire for automation, I architected an automatic
        load/unload mechanism for MRC4 Rollstands, boosting efficiency. I wasn't
        just implementing solutions—I was also keenly attuned to our clients'
        needs, customizing the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with new features
        upon their request. My knack for preventive measures came to the fore
        when I elevated our Cool Vac Double Backer's belt tracking system,
        ingeniously incorporating limit switches to thwart belt damage. But it
        wasn't just hardware where I flourished; I delved deep into the software
        aspects as well. I honed my expertise in Allan Bradley and Beckhoff
        PLCs, and became a go-to authority for Baumuller Drive Tuning.
        Leveraging cutting-edge technology, I was a virtual ally to our field
        service engineers through remote connections. To cap it all, I crafted
        "plug and play" computer images, ensuring a streamlined setup process.
        This multi-faceted role was more than a job—it was a platform where I
        could meld innovation, client-focus, and technical acumen into a
        symphony of continuous improvement.
