        At Proficient Machine & Automation, my journey as a Controls Engineer
        evolved into an expansive tapestry of technical innovation, leadership,
        and customer engagement. On the foundational level, I set the building
        blocks by establishing an AutoCAD Electrical library and
        standards—effectively authoring the ‘language’ through which we
        communicated our engineering ideas. My canvas was broad, as I
        meticulously designed electrical panels that served as the nerve centers
        for custom machinery. But it was in the realm of program creation where
        my specialized skills truly shone. I was the virtuoso behind the
        integration of PLCs, Robots, HMIs, Vision Systems, and more, weaving
        them together in a symphony of technological harmony. I also pioneered
        data-driven intelligence within the organization by developing PC
        integrations for data collection, thus amplifying the efficacy and
        accountability of our systems. Recognizing the imperative of agility in
        the modern world, I implemented a cost-efficient cloud remote support
        system, positioning us a step ahead in customer service. Leadership came
        naturally to me as I spearheaded machinery commissioning and debugging
        processes, acting as the final quality checkpoint before our tailored
        solutions made their way to the client. I made sure that the machinery
        didn't just work in isolation; I ensured its seamless integration into
        customer MES systems, validating its functionality in real-world
        scenarios. At Proficient Machine & Automation, I wasn't merely an
        engineer; I was a custodian of excellence, a conductor of complexity,
        and a champion for customer satisfaction.
