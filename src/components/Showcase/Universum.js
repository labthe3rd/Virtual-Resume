        I served as the Lead Developer for Universum, collaborating closely with
        my client Havengers to construct something truly extraordinary—a virtual
        music venue for Universal Music Sweden. Imagine stepping into the
        pulsating beats of a music venue, except it exists in the virtual plains
        of VRChat. That's what I was tasked to manifest. My toolbelt included
        Unity for game development, with an emphasis on both PC and Android
        platforms, and C# for scripting tailor-made interactions within the game
        engine. But my role was more than just that of a coder; I was the
        maestro directing an orchestra of artists and designers. I employed
        Blender and Gimp as my artistic instruments, and guided my creative team
        to bring the complex tapestry of Havengers' and Universum's vision to
        vivid life. Communication was key, as I maintained a constant dialogue
        with the clients, ensuring that the virtual venue was not just a digital
        construct but an embodiment of their aspirations. The crescendo of this
        project was the first live event in this novel setting—a moment that
        encapsulated months of labor, creativity, and collaboration. For this
        grand premiere, I took on the role of event manager, rallying a team of
        volunteers to help us unfurl this virtual masterpiece to the VRChat
        community. In this whirlwind stint at Universum, I was not just a
        developer or an artist; I was a digital architect of experiences, a
        facilitator of dreams, and the conductor of a groundbreaking virtual
        symphony.
